          Fourteen billion years in the making. Your gifts aren't a coincidence—they're a miracle.
          The question isn't whether you're enough. The question is: are you willing to lead as if you already know you are?

      <h2>Who This Is For</h2>
      <p>
        You've built something real. You lead a team, run a company, shape strategy. You know how to execute.
        But somewhere along the way, leadership started feeling like performance. Like you're running a script
        written by someone else's expectations.
      </p>
      <p>
        You're tired of grinding. Tired of the inner voice that says "not enough" no matter how much you accomplish.
        You want to lead from presence, not pressure. From what's true, not what's safe.
      </p>
      <p>
        This work is for founders and executives who are ready to stop adding more and start subtracting what's in the way.
        Who want their leadership to feel like home—not like hustle.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>What Changes</h2>
      <p>
        We don't work on your "leadership skills." We work on you. Because leadership isn't what you do—it's who you are.
      </p>
      <p>
        Through executive coaching grounded in mindfulness, embodied practice, and a decade of transformational work,
        I help you strip away the performance and reconnect with the leader you already are. We challenge the narratives
        that no longer serve you. We build presence under pressure. We turn self-doubt into self-trust.
      </p>
      <p>
        This isn't therapy. It's not consulting. It's coaching that meets you where strategy and soul intersect.
      </p>

      <h2>The Invitation</h2>
      <p>
        If you're reading this and something resonates—if you feel seen—that's not an accident.
        Book a discovery call. Let's talk about where you are, where you want to be, and whether this work is right for you.
      </p>
      <p>
        Transformation isn't addition. It's subtraction. The path to yourself begins here.

      <h2>What People Say</h2>

      <div class="testimonial">
        <p class="testimonial-text">
          "Working with Jack has been nothing short of transformative. It was an easy decision to renew my contract for a second year.
          Jack starts every session with a grounding breath, which immediately sets the tone for thoughtful, reflective, and meaningful work.
          He's an incredible listener who brings equal parts compassion and accountability to our conversations. When my self-doubt creeps in,
          he calls it out with clarity and kindness, challenging me to focus on what I truly want and how my energy and mindset can help me get there.
          He's taught me to celebrate my wins, embrace my value, and approach challenges with curiosity rather than fear."

        <p class="testimonial-text">
          "When I went full-time into my business, Jack coached me to learn to stay in the pocket and navigate the ups and downs of entrepreneurship.
          And even more than that, Jack has taught me how to better show up for myself through a (new to me) mindfulness practice.
          If it weren't for Jack, I would've doubted myself so much that I'd be back in a W2 job plotting my escape.
          Cannot recommend him enough for high-performers who want more out of life."
